### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bamr87/bamr87.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

The source code for this theme is at [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)
